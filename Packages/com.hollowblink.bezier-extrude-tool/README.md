# Bezier Extrude Tool

## Overview

The Bezier Extrude Tool is a Unity package that allows you to create and manipulate procedural meshes using Bezier curves. This tool is perfect for generating complex shapes and paths with smooth curves.

## Features

- Create procedural meshes using Bezier curves.
- Easily manipulate control points to adjust the shape of the mesh.
- Supports extrusion based on a 2D shape.
- Customizable mesh properties such as segment subdivision.

## Usage

1. After installation, open the Bezier Extrude Tool window from the `Tools > Bezier Extrude Tool` menu.
2. Use the controls in the window to create and manipulate the bezier curve and its extrusion.
3. For creating a new shape, create a new Shape2D asset by right clicking in the project window and selecting `Create > Shape2D`.
4. Shapes 2D work by defining lines composed by 2 vertexes so you'll have to repeat vertexes to define correctly the normals of the shape.
5. Lines must be defined clockwise to work correctly.
